### Introduction

The Graph-Based SIEM Log Analysis Angular plugin is a web-based SIEM (System Information and Event Management) platform dashboard that visualizes network communication patterns using a Cytoscape-style node-edge graph. The platform provides various function pages and panels to help security analysts quickly identify and analyze patterns within the large volumes of SIEM alerts. The dashboard main user interface view is shown below:

The four key features of the program:

- **Node-Edge Graph Visualization**: Represent network nodes (e.g., servers, workstations, routers) as graph nodes, and connections or communication events between them as edges. we use dynamic, interactive graph visualization to allow analysts to zoom, filter, and focus on specific parts of the network and highlight suspicious nodes and connections to draw attention to potential security threats.
- **Integration with Multiple Log Sources**: Aggregate and correlate logs from multiple sources, including Firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), Host Operating Systems.
- **Automated Event Filtering and Prioritization**: Filtering to prioritize events based on predefined rules, Identify and highlight high-risk events that need immediate human intervention, helping analysts focus on the most critical alerts.
- **Data Correlation and Analysis**: Correlate events from different log sources to detect patterns indicative of multi-stage attacks or complex threat scenarios. Enable deeper analysis by linking related events across the network, helping to understand the context of security incidents.

The platform ingests alerts over a configurable period (currently set to 1 month) and generates visual representations of similar activities detected across different log types. Activities are considered similar based on factors such as event signatures, intensity, duration, and specific ports targeted or used. This approach enables faster, more efficient threat identification, allowing security analysts to make informed decisions based on clearer, data-driven insights.

### Data Sources Detail

The system processes logs from three primary sources: **Snort Intrusion Detection System (IDS) logs**, **Fortinet firewall network logs**, and **Windows OS network logs**. These logs can generate thousands of alerts daily, making manual analysis challenging and time-consuming. For instance, Snort IDS logs alone can produce between 4,000 to 16,000 alerts each day. To address this, the platform consolidates similar activities across these log types, simplifying the identification of critical patterns. It further sorts the data using a `Severity Score`, which indicates the potential maliciousness of events, helping analysts prioritize their investigations.

The datasets utilized in this project include:

- **Snort IDS Logs**: Source IP, target IP, source and target ports, signature identifier, and SIEM type.

- **Fortinet Firewall Logs**: Source IP, target IP, source and target ports, event identifier, and SIEM type.

- **Windows Alerts Logs**: Source IP, port, computer name, Windows event ID, and SIEM type.

- **IDS Signature Details**: Contains brief descriptions of event types (e.g., "trojan activity suspected"), along with associated CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) information, MITRE ATT&CK tactics, and techniques. Each signature has a class type and score.

- **Firewall Signature Details**: Includes detailed descriptions related to each event identifier, associated CVEs, and a list of potential impacts.

- **Windows Event Information**: Provides descriptions of Windows event types.

- **MITRE ATT&CK Documentation**: Extracted via MITRE's API, containing information on tactics and techniques, associated Windows event IDs, and taxonomy values like CAPEC (Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification) IDs.

- **CAPEC Documentation**: Enumerates various attack patterns at different abstraction levels. Each CAPEC entry includes a title, description, severity score, and possible impacts.

- **CVE Data**: Downloaded from NISTâ€™s website, this data contains CVE descriptions and scores.

The analysis of these data sources involved using Python scripts and manual inspection to identify ground truth. From this analysis, 14 suspicious cases or sets of events were identified across all three types of logs, providing a basis for further investigation and system improvement.

**What are linked Subgraphs?**

Linked graphs are graphs generated by connecting events across log types - Snort, Fortinet and Windows.

Hence, if graphs generated in Snort and Fortinet have IP addresses in common, then linked graphs between Snort and Fortinet would be generated by connecting these individual graphs, re-calculating the graph severity and consequences. For example:

- Linked Subgraphs `all_logs_sep_2019` contains those graphs which have nodes (IP addresses) found in alerts across all 3 log types - Snort, Fortinet and Windows. 
- Linked Subgraphs `Snort_forti_sep_2019` contains those graphs which have nodes (IP addresses) found in alerts across all Snort and Fortinet. 
- Linked Subgraphs `win_snort_sep_2019` contains those graphs which have nodes (IP addresses) found in alerts across all Snort and Windows.

### System Design 



#### Dashboard User Interface Design 

The Graph-Based SIEM Log Analysis Dashboard contents three main tabs:

**SIEM Log Graph Tab**: Displays case-specific subgraphs, allowing users to view and analyze subsets of the data based on selected cases. Each subgraph visually represents network communication patterns and potential security events.

**Node Detail Tab**: Provides detailed information about a selected node, including its attributes, connections, and relationships within the graph. This view helps users focus on specific nodes and investigate their interactions in greater depth.

**User Guide Tab**: Offers comprehensive instructions on how to navigate and use the platform, ensuring that users can make the most of the dashboard's features and functionalities.

#### SIEM Log Graph Tab Design

The **SIEM-Graph Tab** is the primary interface for visualizing network communication patterns and potential security events. It displays case-specific subgraphs, enabling users to analyze subsets of data based on selected cases.

**Web Page Layout**:

The page is divided into two main areas:

- **Graph Display Area (Left Side)**
- **Information View & Control Area (Right Side)**

The SIEM Log Graph Tab UI is shown below:

**Graph Display Area**

- **Top Left Information Panel**: Provides key details for each graph:
  - **Title**: Shows the dataset name and subgraph ID.
  - **Severity Score**: Displays the severity score, indicating the threat level as calculated by the model.
  - **Number of Events**: Total count of SIEM alerts consolidated to form the graph. For example, a graph labeled "G5" may consolidate 336 individual alerts, significantly reducing the manual effort required for analysis.
  - **Number of Components**: Indicates the spread of the activity across collections of IP addresses, showing whether suspicious behavior is concentrated or widespread.
  - **Max In-Degree Centrality**: Identifies the node (IP address or computer name) with the highest number of incoming edges, indicating targeted behavior.
  - **Max Out-Degree Centrality**: Identifies the source(s) for most edges, showing if behavior originates from a single source or multiple.
  - **Consequences**: Lists potential consequences inferred from the activity patterns, aiding in quick threat assessment.
- **Graph Visualization**: Center of the page, where the graph is displayed. Users can interact with the graph, and detailed information appears upon clicking nodes or edges.

### SIEM Prioritization Use Case

The platform employs two main use cases for prioritizing events within the System Information and Event Management (SIEM) environment:

**Use Case 1: Independent Alert Generation by Network Devices and Endpoint Hosts**
Network devices and endpoint hosts independently generate large volumes of alerts, each containing critical information for threat analysis.

- **Network Logs**: Each alert includes a timestamp, device name, source and destination IP addresses, and ports, along with a signature that identifies the reason for the alert. The signature provides multiple layers of information, such as the type of malicious activity (e.g., Trojan activity), related malware families (if available), MITRE ATT&CK mappings (if applicable), and a brief description of the potential threat (e.g., "SLR Alert â€“ Possible RuRat checking XML elements").

**Use Case 2: Aggregated Event Collection and Prioritization Across Multiple Devices**
The system integrates alerts from multiple sources and generates a consolidated graph that highlights "collections of events" across different log types. By analyzing these event clusters, the platform assigns a severity score to each graph, allowing security analysts to prioritize their focus on critical threats.

- **Host Logs**: Key information includes the computer name (host identifier), user ID, group ID, IP, port, event type (e.g., account login failures where the username is correct but the password is wrong), and object type (e.g., "Logon type 3 â€“ Network").

**Motivating Example**:
To illustrate, the platform can begin by using both network and host logs as data sources. Each type of log provides detailed information essential for threat detection and analysis, enabling the system to correlate events and effectively prioritize them for further investigation.

#### Potential Use Cases

There are also some potential use cases which the system can be applied for:

- **Detecting Lateral Movement**: Track and visualize how an attacker moves across the network after compromising a system.
- **Identifying DDoS Attacks**: Visualize and correlate traffic spikes and unusual communication patterns to identify potential Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks.
- **Monitoring Data Exfiltration**: Track data flows to detect abnormal outbound connections that may indicate data theft.
- **Investigating Failed Login Attempts**: Correlate multiple failed login events across different systems to identify potential brute-force attack attempts.
