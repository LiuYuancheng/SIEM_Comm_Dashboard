**Q 1 .How to view list of graphs generated for a particular time period and log source?**



Currently the demo shows graphs generated for September 2019 and June 2020. Our log sources are SIEM alerts for Snort, Fortinet and Windows. There are several data set in our data base: 

| Idx  | Log Type           | Log Dataset Data base ID                                     |
| ---- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0    | Snort Subgraphs    | subgraphs_snort_sep_2019, subgraphs_snort_june_2020          |
| 1    | Windows Subgraphs  | subgraphs_windows_sep_2019, subgraphs_windows_june_2020      |
| 2    | Fortinet Subgraphs | subgraphs_fortinet_sep_2019, subgraphs_fortinet_june_2020    |
| 3    | Linked Subgraphs   | linked_subgraphs_all_logs_sep_2019, linked_subgraphs_snort_forti_sep_2019, linked_subgraphs_win_snort_sep_2019, linked_subgraphs_snort_forti_june_2020, linked_subgraphs_win_forti_june_2020 |

You can view the list of graphs for a particular log source and month by the dropdown menu (as shown below): For example, to view list of graphs generated for Snort alerts, for September 2019, select Snort Subgraphs: sep_2019.

**What are linked Subgraphs?**

Linked graphs are graphs generated by connecting events across log types - Snort, Fortinet and Windows.

Hence, if graphs generated in Snort and Fortinet have IP addresses in common, then linked graphs between Snort and Fortinet would be generated by connecting these individual graphs, re-calculating the graph severity and consequences. 

- Linked Subgraphs **all_logs_sep_2019** contains those graphs which have nodes (IP addresses) found in alerts across all 3 log types - Snort, Fortinet and Windows. 
- Linked Subgraphs Snort_forti_sep_2019 contains those graphs which have nodes (IP addresses) found in alerts across all Snort and Fortinet. 
- Linked Subgraphs **win_snort_sep_2019** contains those graphs which have nodes (IP addresses) found in alerts across all Snort and Windows.
