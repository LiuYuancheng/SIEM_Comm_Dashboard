User can choose to see Signature / Log Type / Port Values etc as the edge labels by selecting from the dropdown against Edges Label in the **Graph Display Config**.

Similarly, the edge colors can represent the log types which have resulted in the creation of the edge. This functionality is useful when viewing linked graphs. 

The user can also filter edges to view in a graph through the **Graph Filter Config** area.
